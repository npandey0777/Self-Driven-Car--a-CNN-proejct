# Self-Driven-Car--a-CNN-proejct
In this project, around 45000 frontal images taken while driving the car are provided, along with the appropriate steering rotation. Each image's width and height are 455 and 255 pixels, respectively. The analysis will be performed to train the model to suggest the correct steering rotation taken by the car.
